This programme seeks to create a sizing program for the NUS AeroNUS team for purposes of AIAA DBF 2025/2026. 

For training plane 2, we will be designing to complete 2 missions

Mission 1 - fly 2 laps with no payload

Mission 2 - fly 4 laps with payload

Limitations of the plane.
Wing span = 1.2m
Wing loading - max 5.5kg/m^2
Payload = 0.6kg
ratio of Mass of plane to max payload mass = 1.5

Derived from limitations
Mass of plane = 0.9kg
Surface area of wing = (0.9 + 0.6)/5.5 = 0.2727m^2
With no taper for wing, wing chord = 0.23m
Aspect Ratio = 5.22
